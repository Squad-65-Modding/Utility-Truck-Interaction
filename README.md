__FiveM Port 1.0 Beta__

### THIS DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY IN FIVEM - NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED

> While this script does work well for the person using it, no other players can see the bucket moving due to a lack of vehicle animation syncing. Not intended for public use, uploaded in case someone else can figure out how to get it to work. If you find a better way of doing this, please contact me and I'll happily accept a PR.
